Express testing with http request methods

This repository has to be cloned as a whole for the application to work.
This project uses 2 libraries(express for routing, and ejs for dynamic frontend)
Steps to take:

  1. Clone the repository
  2. Go to directory and run `npm install` to automatically install required libraries (i have not tested this myslef but it should work...)
  3. Run index.js with `node index.js`
  
## To test http requests on localhost:3000/messages/ with postman.

Open 'create a request' on postman, add `localhost:3000/messages/`. Applicatin can read `messagetitle` and`messagecontent` JSON  body values as well as id values from url parameter after `/messages/`.
